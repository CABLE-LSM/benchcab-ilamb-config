# benchcab-ilamb-config
An ILAMB configuration for evaluating model outputs produced by [benchcab](https://github.com/CABLE-LSM/benchcab).

Note: CABLE model outputs require some post processing for usage with ILAMB. The required changes to the model output are documented [here](https://github.com/CABLE-LSM/benchcab-ilamb-config/issues/1).
